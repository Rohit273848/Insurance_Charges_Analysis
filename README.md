ðŸ“Š Insurance Charges Prediction (ML Project)

This project focuses on predicting insurance charges using Machine Learning techniques. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, statistical testing, and model building.

âœ… Progress So Far

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Created BMI groups

Encoded smoker status

Categorized regions

ðŸ”¹ Feature Analysis

Applied Pearson Correlation to identify numerical features influencing charges

Used Chi-Square tests to validate categorical features

âœ¨ Key Insights

Smoker status and BMI categories show the strongest correlation with charges.

Chi-Square testing helped refine which categorical features to keep vs. drop.

ðŸš€ Next Steps

Apply feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler).

Build and evaluate ML models for prediction.

ðŸ”— Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a work-in-progress project where I share updates, experiments, and progress in building an end-to-end ML pipeline.
